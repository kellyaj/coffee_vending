Coffee Vending
=============
We're going to be building a simple vending machine using CoffeeScript and all of the tools we've learned so far. I've added a very simple `index.html` file that you will be using. You will need to add any compiled javascript files to this `index.html` file. There will also be some pre-made DOM elements that you will need to interact with.
